Create ViewSets:

In listings/views.py, create viewsets for Listing and Booking using Django REST framework’s ModelViewSet.
Ensure that these views provide CRUD operations for both models.
Configure URLs:

Use a router to configure URLs for the API endpoints.
Ensure endpoints follow RESTful conventions and are accessible under /api/.
Test Endpoints:
